HOTEL WEBSITE - BUG REPORT & PROJECT OVERVIEW
Generated: December 4, 2025
=========================================

PROJECT STRUCTURE
-----------------
html/ - All HTML pages (MainPage, BookingPage, Rooms, Services, Gallery, Contact)
css/  - Stylesheets for each page + Menu.css shared across all pages
js/   - JavaScript files (Booking.js, Contact.js, Menu.js)
img/  - All images (backgrounds, room photos, logos)

KEY FILES & LOCATIONS
---------------------
• MainPage.html - Landing page with hero carousel, room previews, location, membership
• BookingPage.html - Reservation form with payment modal (card validation implemented)
• Rooms.html - Three room types with expanded carousels (70% width, 500px height)
• Services.html - Service cards on wine.jpg background with glass effect
• Gallery.html - Image grid showcase
• Contact.html - Two-column layout (info cards + contact form)
• Booking.js - Form validation, payment modal, card validation (16 digits, expiry check, CVV)
• Contact.js - Contact form validation with email pattern check
• Menu.js - Hamburger menu functionality across all pages

HIGH PRIORITY (1)
-----------------
1. Footer Styling Inconsistent
   - BookingPage has white footer, other pages have transparent(Mostly due to background)
   - Fix: Standardize across all pages

MEDIUM PRIORITY (3)
-------------------
2. Page Height Inconsistency
   - Contact: 150vh, Services: 150vh, Gallery: standard, Rooms: standard
   - Fix: Standardize min-height values

3. CSS Readability
   - All CSS condensed to single lines makes debugging harder
   - Consider expanding for maintainability

4. Menu HTML Duplicated
   - Menu code copied across all 7 HTML files
   - Consider: Centralized menu component loaded via JavaScript

5. Contact Form No Backend
   - Form only shows alert, doesn't send data to server
   - Action: Implement backend API endpoint if needed for production

LOW PRIORITY (3)
----------------
6. Test Files Present
   - test.html and test.css should be removed before deployment

7. Accessibility
   - Carousel images use generic alt text ("Room image")
   - Add descriptive alt text for screen readers

8. Performance
   - Large background images (View.jpg, wine.jpg) not optimized
   - Fixed backgrounds may impact mobile performance
